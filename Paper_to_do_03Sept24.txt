Issue with Upi\s fitting algo,
remove 1sq,
stat annotations are good,
cell: 1621, check the time of fitting points (valley time and peak time), check stim start time.
Upi's newest script for fitting: stp_peaks_and_refs.py

Delay against what?
only show sublinearity
delay I-E vs numSq
delay of I-E vs EPSCmax

How to proceed from here:
1. Introduction: add more refs?
2. Figure 1:
	Setup: protocol design
	standardization: How CA3 stim is, desensitization (field, supplementary)
	characterization: CA3 response map, CA3-Field relation, Field-CA1 relation
	Conclusion: protocol is designed to probe the I/O relationship in multiple dimensions.
	Status: Legend done, description done
3. Figure 2:
	EPSP response in current clamp (?)
	Fitting
	PSC vs factors heatmap
	a measure of effect: synaptic impact, charge etc
	Measure of plasticity for E and I: PPR, STPR etc
	SVM or MEM model (?)
	Conclusion: 1. short-term plasticity properties of E and I are co-tuned/depressing/potentiating/ 2. Which factor is most important
	Status: remainder: analysis, plotting, arranging
4. Figure 3:
	How do E and I combine to cause normalization (SDN or slope)
	What is normalization?
	Distribution of gamma and slope, stats (?)
	Gamma and slope heatmap
	Delay(E-I) vs EPSCpeak
	across cell distribution (?)
	conclusion: second pulse has the highest chance of escape, delay is statistically significant(?), normalization is statistically significant (?)
	Status: stats to be done, delay plots, across cell distribution
