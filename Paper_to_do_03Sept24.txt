Issue with Upi's fitting algo,
remove 1sq,
stat annotations are good,
cell: 1621, check the time of fitting points (valley time and peak time), check stim start time.
Upi's newest script for fitting: stp_peaks_and_refs.py

Delay against what?
only show sublinearity
delay I-E vs numSq
delay of I-E vs EPSCmax

How to proceed from here:
1. Introduction: add more refs?
2. Figure 1: DONE
	Setup: protocol design
	standardization: How CA3 stim is, desensitization (field, supplementary)
	characterization: CA3 response map, CA3-Field relation, Field-CA1 relation
	Conclusion: protocol is designed to probe the I/O relationship in multiple dimensions.
	Status: Legend done, description done
3. Figure 2: DONE
	EPSP response in current clamp (?)
	Fitting: Done
	PSC vs factors heatmap: Done
	a measure of effect: synaptic impact, charge etc: XXX
	Measure of plasticity for E and I: PPR, STPR etc
	SVM or MEM model (?)
	Conclusion: 1. short-term plasticity properties of E and I are co-tuned/depressing/potentiating/ 2. Which factor is most important
	Status: Legend Done. Description remaining.
4. Figure 3:
	How do E and I combine to cause normalization (SDN or slope): Covered in Aanchal's paper, no need to repeat
	What is normalization?: XXX
	Distribution of gamma and slope: Done
	Gamma and slope heatmap: Done
	Delay(E-I) vs EPSCpeak: TODO
	Delay(E-I) vs numSq, freq, pulseindex: TODO
	across cell distribution (?): TODO
	conclusion: second pulse has the highest chance of escape, delay is statistically significant(?), normalization is statistically significant (?)
	Status: stats to be done, delay plots, across cell distribution
5. Figure 6:
	E:I vs frequency
	E:I vs frequency for each individual cell
