The stability of cortical neuron activity in vivo suggests that the firing rates of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are dynamically adjusted. Using dual recordings from excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory fast-spiking neurons in neocortical slices, we report that sustained activation by trains of several hundred presynaptic spikes resulted in much stronger depression of synaptic currents at excitatory synapses than at inhibitory ones. The steady-state synaptic depression was frequency dependent and reflected presynaptic function. These results suggest that inhibitory terminals of fast-spiking cells are better equipped to support prolonged transmitter release at a high frequency compared with excitatory ones. This difference in frequency-dependent depression could produce a relative increase in the impact of inhibition during periods of high global activity and promote the stability of cortical circuits.

The vast majority of synaptic connections onto neurons in the cerebral cortex arise from other cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, forming local and distant 'recurrent' networks. Although this is a basic theme of cortical organization, its study has been limited largely to theoretical investigations, which predict that local recurrent networks show a proportionality or balance between recurrent excitation and inhibition, allowing the generation of stable periods of activity. This recurrent activity might underlie such diverse operations as short-term memory, the modulation of neuronal excitability with attention, and the generation of spontaneous activity during sleep. Here we show that local cortical circuits do indeed operate through a proportional balance of excitation and inhibition generated through local recurrent connections, and that the operation of such circuits can generate self-sustaining activity that can be turned on and off by synaptic inputs. These results confirm the long-hypothesized role of recurrent activity as a basic operation of the cerebral cortex.

Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is an important mechanism for modifying neural circuits during computation. Although STP is much studied, its role in the processing of complex natural spike patterns is unknown. Here we analyze the responses of excitatory and inhibitory hippocampal synapses to natural spike trains at near-physiological temperatures. Our results show that excitatory and inhibitory synapses express complementary sets of STP components that selectively change synaptic strength during epochs of high-frequency discharge associated with hippocampal place fields. In both types of synapses, synaptic strength rapidly alternates between a near-constant level during low activity and another near-constant, but elevated (for excitatory synapses) or reduced (for inhibitory synapses) level during high-frequency epochs. These history-dependent changes in synaptic strength are largely independent of the particular temporal pattern within the discharges, and occur concomitantly in the two types of synapses. When excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory synapses are co-activated within the hippocampal feed-forward circuit unit, the net effect of their complementary STP is an additional increase in the gain of excitatory synapses during high-frequency discharges via selective disinhibition. Thus, excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory hippocampal synapses in vitro act synergistically as an adaptive filter that operates in a switch-like manner and is selective for high-frequency epochs.

The high degree of variability observed in spike trains and membrane potentials of pyramidal neurons in vivo is thought to be a consequence of a balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, which depends on the dynamics of the network. We simulated synaptic currents and ion channels in a reconstructed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell and show here that a local balance can be achieved on a dendritic branch with a different mechanism, based on presynaptic depression of quantal release interacting with active dendritic conductances. This mechanism, which does not require synaptic inhibition, allows each dendritic branch to remain sensitive to correlated synaptic inputs, induces a high degree of variability in the output spike train, and can be combined with other balance mechanisms based on network dynamics. This hypothesis makes a testable prediction for the cause of the observed variability in the firing of hippocampal place cells.

In somatosensory cortex, the relative balance of excitation and inhibition determines how effectively feedforward inhibition enforces the temporal fidelity of action potentials. Within the CA3 region of the hippocampus, glutamatergic mossy fiber (MF) synapses onto CA3 pyramidal cells (PCs) provide strong monosynaptic excitation that exhibit prominent facilitation during repetitive activity. We demonstrate in the juvenile CA3 that MF-driven polysynaptic IPSCs facilitate to maintain a fixed EPSC-IPSC ratio during short-term plasticity. In contrast, in young adult mice this MF-driven polysynaptic inhibitory input can facilitate or depress in response to short trains of activity. Transgenic mice lacking the feedback inhibitory loop continue to exhibit both facilitating and depressing polysynaptic IPSCs, indicating that this robust inhibition is not caused by the secondary engagement of feedback inhibition. Surprisingly, eliminating MF-driven inhibition onto CA3 pyramidal cells by blockade of GABA(A) receptors did not lead to a loss of temporal precision of the first action potential observed after a stimulus but triggered in many cases a long excitatory plateau potential capable of triggering repetitive action potential firing. These observations indicate that, unlike other regions of the brain, the temporal precision of single MF-driven action potentials is dictated primarily by the kinetics of MF EPSPs, not feedforward inhibition. Instead, feedforward inhibition provides a robust regulation of CA3 PC excitability across development to prevent excessive depolarization by the monosynaptic EPSP and multiple action potential firings.

Cortical neurons receive balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry.

Until recently, the study of plasticity of neural circuits focused almost exclusively on potentiation and depression at excitatory synapses on principal cells. Other elements in the neural circuitry, such as inhibitory synapses on principal cells and the synapses recruiting interneurons, were assumed to be relatively inflexible, as befits a role of inhibition in maintaining stable levels and accurate timing of neuronal activity. It is now evident that inhibition is highly plastic, with multiple underlying cellular mechanisms. This Review considers these recent developments, focusing mainly on functional and structural changes in GABAergic inhibition of principal cells and long-term plasticity of glutamateric recruitment of inhibitory interneurons in the mammalian forebrain. A major challenge is to identify the adaptive roles of these different forms of plasticity, taking into account the roles of inhibition in the regulation of excitability, generation of population oscillations, and precise timing of neuronal firing.

During rest, the mammalian cortex displays spontaneous neural activity. Spiking of single neurons during rest has been described as irregular and asynchronous. In contrast, recent in vivo and in vitro population measures of spontaneous activity, using the LFP, EEG, MEG or fMRI suggest that the default state of the cortex is critical, manifested by spontaneous, scale-invariant, cascades of activity known as neuronal avalanches. Criticality keeps a network poised for optimal information processing, but this view seems to be difficult to reconcile with apparently irregular single neuron spiking. Here, we simulate a 10,000 neuron, deterministic, plastic network of spiking neurons. We show that a combination of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity enables these networks to exhibit criticality in the face of intrinsic, i.e. self-sustained, asynchronous spiking. Brief external perturbations lead to adaptive, long-term modification of intrinsic network connectivity through long-term excitatory plasticity, whereas long-term inhibitory plasticity enables rapid self-tuning of the network back to a critical state. The critical state is characterized by a branching parameter oscillating around unity, a critical exponent close to -3/2 and a long tail distribution of a self-similarity parameter between 0.5 and 1.

Many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders involve an imbalance between excitation and inhibition caused by synaptic alterations. The proper excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance is especially critical in CA1 pyramidal cells, because they control hippocampal output. Activation of Schaffer collateral axons causes direct excitation of CA1 pyramidal cells, quickly followed by disynaptic feedforward inhibition, stemming from synaptically induced firing of GABAergic interneurons. Both excitatory and inhibitory synapses are modulated by short-term plasticity, potentially causing dynamic tuning of the E/I ratio. However, the effects of short-term plasticity on the E/I ratio in CA1 pyramidal cells are not yet known. To determine this, we recorded disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents and the E/I ratio in CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from juvenile mice. We found that, whereas inhibitory synapses had paired-pulse depression, disynaptic inhibition instead had paired-pulse facilitation (â‰¤Â 200-ms intervals), caused by increased recruitment of feedforward interneurons. Although enhanced disynaptic inhibition helped to constrain paired-pulse facilitation of excitation, the E/I ratio was still larger on the second pulse, increasing pyramidal cell spiking. Surprisingly, this occurred without compromising the precision of spike timing. The E/I balance regulates the temporal spike integration window from multiple inputs; here, we showed that paired-pulse stimulation can broaden the spike integration window. Together, our findings show that the combined effects of short-term plasticity of disynaptic inhibition and monosynaptic excitation alter the E/I balance in CA1 pyramidal cells, leading to dynamic modulation of spike probability and the spike integration window. Short-term plasticity is therefore an important mechanism for modulating signal processing of hippocampal output.

Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

The stimulus selectivity of synaptic currents in cortical neurons often shows a co-tuning of excitation and inhibition, but the mechanisms that underlie the emergence and plasticity of this co-tuning are not fully understood. Using a computational model, we show that an interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity reproduces both the developmental and – when combined with a disinhibitory gate – the adult plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields in auditory cortex. The co-tuning arises from inhibitory plasticity that balances excitation and inhibition, while excitatory stimulus selectivity can result from two different mechanisms. Inhibitory inputs with a broad stimulus tuning introduce a sliding threshold as in Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rules, introducing an excitatory stimulus selectivity at the cost of a broader inhibitory receptive field. Alternatively, input asymmetries can be amplified by synaptic competition. The latter leaves any receptive field plasticity transient, a prediction we verify in recordings in auditory cortex.

While reading a book in a noisy cafÃ©, how does your brain 'gate in' visual information while filtering out auditory stimuli? Here we propose a mechanism for such flexible routing of information flow in a complex brain network (pathway-specific gating), tested using a network model of pyramidal neurons and three classes of interneurons with connection probabilities constrained by data. We find that if inputs from different pathways cluster on a pyramidal neuron dendrite, a pathway can be gated-on by a disinhibitory circuit motif. The branch-specific disinhibition can be achieved despite dense interneuronal connectivity, even with random connections. Moreover, clustering of input pathways on dendrites can naturally emerge through synaptic plasticity regulated by dendritic inhibition. This gating mechanism in a neural circuit is further demonstrated by performing a context-dependent decision-making task. The model suggests that cognitive flexibility engages top-down signalling of behavioural rule or context that targets specific classes of inhibitory neurons.

Computational neuroscience has a long-standing tradition of investigating the consequences of excitatory synaptic plasticity. In contrast, the functions of inhibitory plasticity are still largely nebulous, particularly given the bewildering diversity of interneurons in the brain. Here, we review recent computational advances that provide first suggestions for the functional roles of inhibitory plasticity, such as a maintenance of the excitation-inhibition balance, a stabilization of recurrent network dynamics and a decorrelation of sensory responses. The field is still in its infancy, but given the existing body of theory for excitatory plasticity, it is likely to mature quickly and deliver important insights into the self-organization of inhibitory circuits in the brain.

Inhibitory neurons, although relatively few in number, exert powerful control over brain circuits. They stabilize network activity in the face of strong feedback excitation and actively engage in computations. Recent studies reveal the importance of a precise balance of excitation and inhibition in neural circuits, which often requires exquisite fine-tuning of inhibitory connections. We review inhibitory synaptic plasticity and its roles in shaping both feedforward and feedback control. We discuss the necessity of complex, codependent plasticity mechanisms to build nontrivial, functioning networks, and we end by summarizing experimental evidence of such interactions.

Neurons and networks in the cerebral cortex must operate reliably despite multiple sources of noise. To evaluate the impact of both input and output noise, we determine the robustness of single-neuron stimulus selective responses, as well as the robustness of attractor states of networks of neurons performing memory tasks. We find that robustness to output noise requires synaptic connections to be in a balanced regime in which excitation and inhibition are strong and largely cancel each other. We evaluate the conditions required for this regime to exist and determine the properties of networks operating within it. A plausible synaptic plasticity rule for learning that balances weight configurations is presented. Our theory predicts an optimal ratio of the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses for maximizing the encoding capacity of balanced networks for given statistics of afferent activations. Previous work has shown that balanced networks amplify spatiotemporal variability and account for observed asynchronous irregular states. Here we present a distinct type of balanced network that amplifies small changes in the impinging signals and emerges automatically from learning to perform neuronal and network functions robustly.

Hippocampal neurons become tuned to stimuli that predict behaviorally salient outcomes. This plasticity suggests that memory formation depends upon shifts in how different anatomical inputs can drive hippocampal activity. Here, I present evidence that inhibitory neurons can provide such a mechanism for learning-related changes in the tuning of pyramidal cells. Inhibitory currents arriving on the dendrites of pyramidal cells determine whether an excitatory input can drive action potential output. Specificity and plasticity of this dendritic modulation allows for precise, modifiable changes in how afferent inputs are integrated, a process that defines a neuron's receptive field. In addition, feedback inhibition plays a fundamental role in biasing which excitatory neurons may be co-active. By defining the rules of synchrony and the rules of input integration, interneurons likely play an important role in the organization of memory representation within the hippocampus.

Short-term plasticity enables synaptic strength to be dynamically regulated by input timing. Excitatory synapses arising from the same axon can have profoundly different presynaptic forms of short-term plasticity onto inhibitory and excitatory neurons. We previously showed that Schaffer collateral synapses onto most hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons have less paired-pulse facilitation than synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells, but little difference in steady-state short-term depression. However, less is known about how synapses onto interneurons respond to temporally complex patterns that occur in vivo. Here we compared Schaffer collateral synapses onto stratum radiatum interneurons and pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices in response to physiologically-derived spike trains. We find that synapses onto interneurons have less short-term facilitation than synapses onto pyramidal cells, and a subset expresses only short-term depression. Mathematical modeling predicts this target cell-specific short-term plasticity occurs through differences in initial release probability. All three groups have more short-term facilitation during physiologically-derived train stimulation than during constant-frequency stimulation at the same frequency, indicating that variability in stimulus timing is important. These target-cell specific differences in short-term plasticity reduce the strength of excitatory input onto interneurons relative to pyramidal cells, and of depression interneurons relative to facilitation interneurons, during high frequency portions of the train. This occurs to a similar extent at 25â€¯Â°C and at 33â€¯Â°C, and is even greater at physiological extracellular calcium. Target-cell specific differences in short-term plasticity enable synapses to have different temporal filtering characteristics, which may help to dynamically regulate the balance of inhibition and excitation in CA1.

Spontaneous brain activity is characterized in part by a balanced asynchronous chaotic state. Cortical recordings show that excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) drivings in the E-I balanced state are substantially larger than the overall input. We show that such a state arises naturally in fully adapting networks which are deterministic, autonomously active and not subject to stochastic external or internal drivings. Temporary imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory inputs lead to large but short-lived activity bursts that stabilize irregular dynamics. We simulate autonomous networks of rate-encoding neurons for which all synaptic weights are plastic and subject to a Hebbian plasticity rule, the flux rule, that can be derived from the stationarity principle of statistical learning. Moreover, the average firing rate is regulated individually via a standard homeostatic adaption of the bias of each neuron's input-output non-linear function. Additionally, networks with and without short-term plasticity are considered. E-I balance may arise only when the mean excitatory and inhibitory weights are themselves balanced, modulo the overall activity level. We show that synaptic weight balance, which has been considered hitherto as given, naturally arises in autonomous neural networks when the here considered self-limiting Hebbian synaptic plasticity rule is continuously active.

We introduce the concept of "silent learning"-the capacity to learn despite neuronal cell-firing being largely absent. This idea emerged from thinking about dendritic computation [1, 2] and examining whether the encoding, expression, and retrieval of hippocampal-dependent memory could be dissociated using the intrahippocampal infusion of pharmacological compounds. We observed that very modest enhancement of GABAergic inhibition with low-dose muscimol blocked both cell-firing and the retrieval of an already-formed memory but left induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and new spatial memory encoding intact (silent learning). In contrast, blockade of hippocampal NMDA receptors by intrahippocampal D-AP5 impaired both the induction of LTP and encoding but had no effect on memory retrieval. Blockade of AMPA receptors by CNQX impaired excitatory synaptic transmission and cell-firing and both memory encoding and retrieval. Thus, in keeping with the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis [3], the hippocampal network can mediate new memory encoding when LTP induction is intact even under conditions in which somatic cell-firing is blocked.

Inhibition plays a powerful role in regulating network excitation and plasticity; however, the activity of defined interneuron types during spatial exploration remain poorly understood. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we recorded hippocampal CA1 somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as mice performed a goal-directed spatial navigation task in new visual virtual reality (VR) contexts. Activity in both interneuron classes was strongly suppressed but recovered as animals learned to adapt the previously learned task to the new spatial context. Surprisingly, although there was a range of activity suppression across the population, individual somatostatin-expressing interneurons showed consistent levels of activity modulation across exposure to multiple novel environments, suggesting context-independent, stable network roles during spatial exploration. This work reveals population-level temporally dynamic interneuron activity in new environments, within which each interneuron shows stable and consistent activity modulation.

A complex array of inhibitory interneurons tightly controls hippocampal activity, but how such diversity specifically affects memory processes is not well understood. We find that a small subclass of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R)-expressing hippocampal interneurons determines episodic-like memory consolidation by linking dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) signaling to GABAergic transmission. Mice lacking CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in D<sub>1</sub>-positive cells (D<sub>1</sub>-CB<sub>1</sub>-KO) display impairment in long-term, but not short-term, novel object recognition memory (NOR). Re-expression of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in hippocampal D<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells rescues this NOR deficit. Learning induces an enhancement of inÂ vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which is absent in mutant mice. CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated NOR and the associated LTP facilitation involve local control of GABAergic inhibition in a D<sub>1</sub>-dependent manner. This study reveals that hippocampal CB<sub>1</sub>R-/D<sub>1</sub>R-expressing interneurons control NOR memory, identifying a mechanism linking the diversity of hippocampal interneurons to specific behavioral outcomes.

Cortical areas comprise multiple types of inhibitory interneurons, with stereotypical connectivity motifs that may follow specific plasticity rules. Yet, their combined effect on postsynaptic dynamics has been largely unexplored. Here, we analyze the response of a single postsynaptic model neuron receiving tuned excitatory connections alongside inhibition from two plastic populations. Synapses from each inhibitory population change according to distinct plasticity rules. We tested different combinations of three rules: Hebbian, anti-Hebbian, and homeostatic scaling. Depending on the inhibitory plasticity rule, synapses become unspecific (flat), anticorrelated to, or correlated with excitatory synapses. Crucially, the neuron's receptive field (i.e., its response to presynaptic stimuli) depends on the modulatory state of inhibition. When both inhibitory populations are active, inhibition balances excitation, resulting in uncorrelated postsynaptic responses regardless of the inhibitory tuning profiles. Modulating the activity of a given inhibitory population produces strong correlations to either preferred or nonpreferred inputs, in line with recent experimental findings that show dramatic context-dependent changes of neurons' receptive fields. We thus confirm that a neuron's receptive field does not follow directly from the weight profiles of its presynaptic afferents. Our results show how plasticity rules in various cell types can interact to shape cortical circuit motifs and their dynamics.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in sensory areas of the cortex are known to respond to specific features of a given input (e.g., specific sound frequencies), but recent experimental studies show that such responses (i.e., their receptive fields) depend on context. Inspired by the cortical connectivity, we built models of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto a single neuron, to study how receptive fields may change on short and long time scales. We show how various synaptic plasticity rules allow for the emergence of diverse connectivity profiles and, moreover, how their dynamic interaction creates a mechanism by which postsynaptic responses can quickly change. Our work emphasizes multiple roles of inhibition in cortical processing and provides a first mechanistic model for flexible receptive fields.

During the exploration of novel environments, place fields are rapidly formed in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Place cell firing rate increases in early stages of exploration of novel environments but returns to baseline levels in familiar environments. Although similar in amplitude and width, place fields in familiar environments are more stable than in novel environments. We propose a computational model of the hippocampal CA1 network, which describes the formation, dynamics and stabilization of place fields. We show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form place fields, dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for place field stabilization. Our model suggests that place cell stability can be attributed to strong excitatory synaptic weights and strong dendritic inhibition. We show that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, such that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. Our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Finally, we predict that artificially induced dendritic events can shift place fields even after place field stabilization.

Synaptic plasticity is the cellular and molecular counterpart of learning and memory and, since its first discovery, the analysis of the mechanisms underlying long-term changes of synaptic strength has been almost exclusively focused on excitatory connections. Conversely, inhibition was considered as a fixed controller of circuit excitability. Only recently, inhibitory networks were shown to be finely regulated by a wide number of mechanisms residing in their synaptic connections. Here, we review recent findings on the forms of inhibitory plasticity (IP) that have been discovered and characterized in different brain areas. In particular, we focus our attention on the molecular pathways involved in the induction and expression mechanisms leading to changes in synaptic efficacy, and we discuss, from the computational perspective, how IP can contribute to the emergence of functional properties of brain circuits.

The brain consists of many interconnected networks with time-varying, partially autonomous activity. There are multiple sources of noise and variation yet activity has to eventually converge to a stable, reproducible state (or sequence of states) for its computations to make sense. We approached this problem from a control-theory perspective by applying contraction analysis to recurrent neural networks. This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving stability in multiple connected networks with biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms included inhibitory Hebbian plasticity, excitatory anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Our findings shed light on how stable computations might be achieved despite biological complexity.

"The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but 
correlated. Dynamic excitatoryÃ¢â‚¬â€œinhibitory balance is a plausible 
mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear
 how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In 
particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in
 the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced 
activity impacts learning. How does the dynamics of balanced networks 
change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking 
activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their 
eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these 
questions, we develop a general theory of plasticity in balanced 
networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under 
plasticity induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the 
input mildly, but significantly affect the evolution of synaptic 
weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of 
correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these 
rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space 
with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the 
network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the 
dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive 
targeted optogenetic input."

The formation and maintenance of spatial representations within hippocampal cell assemblies is strongly dictated by patterns of inhibition from diverse interneuron populations. Although it is known that inhibitory synaptic strength is malleable, induction of long-term plasticity at distinct inhibitory synapses and its regulation of hippocampal network activity is not well understood. Here, we show that inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons undergo long-term depression and potentiation respectively (PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP) during physiological activity patterns. Both forms of plasticity rely on T-type calcium channel activation to confer synapse specificity but otherwise employ distinct mechanisms. Since parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons preferentially target perisomatic and distal dendritic regions respectively of CA1 pyramidal cells, PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP coordinate a reprioritisation of excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex and CA3. Furthermore, circuit-level modelling reveals that PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP cooperate to stabilise place cells while facilitating representation of multiple unique environments within the hippocampal network.

A distinctive feature of the hippocampal structure is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons. These complex inhibitory interconnections largely contribute to the tight modulation of hippocampal circuitry, as well as to the formation and coordination of neuronal assemblies underlying learning and memory. Inhibitory interneurons provide more than a simple transitory inhibition of hippocampal principal cells (PCs). The synaptic plasticity of inhibitory neurons provides long-lasting changes in the hippocampal network and is a key component of memory formation. The dendrite targeting interneurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SOM) are particularly interesting in this regard because they display unique long-lasting synaptic changes leading to metaplastic regulation of hippocampal networks. In this article, we examine the actions of the neuropeptide SOM on hippocampal cells, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We address the different subtypes of hippocampal SOM interneurons. We describe the long-term synaptic plasticity that takes place at the excitatory synapses of SOM interneurons, its singular induction and expression mechanisms, as well as the consequences of these changes on the hippocampal network, learning, and memory. We also review evidence that astrocytes provide cell-specific dynamic regulation of inhibition of PC dendrites by SOM interneurons. Finally, we cover how, in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dysfunction of plasticity of SOM interneuron excitatory synapses may also contribute to cognitive impairments in brain disorders.

Coordinated excitatory and inhibitory activity is required for proper brain functioning. Recent computational and experimental studies have demonstrated that activity patterns in recurrent cortical networks are dominated by inhibition. Whereas previous studies have suggested that inhibitory plasticity is important for homeostatic control, this new framework puts inhibition in the driver's seat. Complex neuronal networks in the brain comprise many configurations in parallel, controlled by external and internal 'switches'. Context-dependent modulation and plasticity of inhibitory connections play a key role in memory and learning. It is therefore important to realize that synaptic plasticity is often multisynaptic and that a proper balance between excitation and inhibition is not fixed, but depends on context and activity level.

Despite ongoing experiential change, neural activity maintains remarkable stability. Although this is thought to be mediated by homeostatic plasticity, what aspect of neural activity is conserved and how the flexibility necessary for learning and memory is maintained is not fully understood. Experimental studies suggest that there exists network-centered, in addition to the well-studied neuron-centered, control. Here we computationally study such a potential mechanism: input-dependent inhibitory plasticity (IDIP). In a hippocampal model, we show that IDIP can explain the emergence of active and silent place cells as well as remapping following silencing of active place cells. Furthermore, we show that IDIP can also stabilize recurrent dynamics while preserving firing rate heterogeneity and stimulus representation, as well as persistent activity after memory encoding. Hence, the establishment of global network balance with IDIP has diverse functional implications and may be able to explain experimental phenomena across different brain areas.

Hippocampal place cells form a physiological substrate for spatial navigation and memory in the  brain. Remarkably, CA1 pyramidal neurons can acquire stable place fields in a few trials through a  novel behavioral timescale" synaptic plasticity rule (BTSP). While this process can enable rapid  learning, local feedback circuits likely tightly restrict the recruitment of individual cells into  ensemble representations; this interaction between local circuit dynamics and BTSP remains  unexplored. Here we developed \all-optical" approaches that combine novel optogenetic induction of  place fields via BTSP in CA1 pyramidal cells with 2-photon calcium activity imaging during spatial  navigation. We find that induction efficacy depends strongly on the density of co-activated neurons.  Place fields can be reliably induced in single cells, but induction fails during co-activation of larger  CA1 populations. Our results implicate local circuit constraints on the induction of place fields,  whereby recurrent inhibition regulates the prevalence of BTSP across the ensemble. Consistent with  this interpretation, we found that temporary relief of local inhibition permitted the simultaneous  induction of place fields in larger CA1 ensembles. We demonstrate the behavioral consequences of  these dynamics, as applying our ensemble optogenetic induction protocol at an arbitrary location  enhanced animals' subsequent performance in a spatial reward learning task involving that location.

How can neural networks learn to efficiently represent complex and high-dimensional inputs via local plasticity mechanisms? Classical models of representation learning assume that feedforward weights are learned via pairwise Hebbian-like plasticity. Here, we show that pairwise Hebbian-like plasticity works only under unrealistic requirements on neural dynamics and input statistics. To overcome these limitations, we derive from first principles a learning scheme based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. Here, recurrent connections learn to locally balance feedforward input in individual dendritic compartments and thereby can modulate synaptic plasticity to learn efficient representations. We demonstrate in simulations that this learning scheme works robustly even for complex high-dimensional inputs and with inhibitory transmission delays, where Hebbian-like plasticity fails. Our results draw a direct connection between dendritic excitatory-inhibitory balance and voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity as observed in vivo and suggest that both are crucial for representation learning.

Humans are able to continually learn new information and acquire skills that meet the demands of an ever-changing environment. Yet, this new learning does not necessarily occur at the expense of old memories. The specialised biological mechanisms that permit continual learning in humans and other mammals are not fully understood. Here I explore the possibility that neural inhibition plays an important role. I present recent findings from studies in humans that suggest inhibition regulates the stability of neural networks to gate cortical plasticity and memory retrieval. These studies use non-invasive methods to obtain an indirect measure of neural inhibition and corroborate comparable findings in animals. Together these studies reveal a model whereby neural inhibition protects memories from interference to permit continual learning. Neural inhibition may, therefore, play a critical role in the computations that underlie higher-order cognition and adaptive behaviour.

Memory models often emphasize the need to encode novel patterns of neural activity imposed by sensory drive. Prior learning and innate architecture likely restrict neural plasticity, however. Here, we test how the incorporation of synthetic hippocampal signals is constrained by preexisting circuit dynamics. We optogenetically stimulated small groups of CA1 neurons as mice traversed a chosen segment of a linear track, mimicking the emergence of place fields. Stimulation induced persistent place field remapping in stimulated and non-stimulated neurons. The emergence of place fields could be predicted from sporadic firing in the new place field location and the temporal relationship to peer neurons before the optogenetic perturbation. Circuit modification was reflected by altered spike transmission between connected pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, which persisted during post-experience sleep. We hypothesize that optogenetic perturbation unmasked sub-threshold place fields. Plasticity in recurrent/lateral inhibition may drive learning through the rapid association of existing states.

Neural network models are potential tools for improving our understanding of complex brain functions. To address this goal, these models need to be neurobiologically realistic. However, although neural networks have advanced dramatically in recent years and even achieve human-like performance on complex perceptual and cognitive tasks, their similarity to aspects of brain anatomy and physiology is imperfect. Here, we discuss different types of neural models, including localist, auto-associative, hetero-associative, deep and whole-brain networks, and identify aspects under which their biological plausibility can be improved. These aspects range from the choice of model neurons and of mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and learning to implementation of inhibition and control, along with neuroanatomical properties including areal structure and local and long-range connectivity. We highlight recent advances in developing biologically grounded cognitive theories and in mechanistically explaining, on the basis of these brain-constrained neural models, hitherto unaddressed issues regarding the nature, localization and ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of higher brain functions. In closing, we point to possible future clinical applications of brain-constrained modelling.

The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated. Dynamic excitatory-inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How do the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a theory of spike-timing dependent plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity-induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.

The transmission of high frequency temporal information across brain regions is critical to perception, but the mechanisms underlying such transmission remain unclear. Long-range projection patterns across brain areas are often comprised of paired feed-forward excitation followed closely by delayed inhibition, including the thalamic triad synapse, thalamic projections to cortex, and projections within the hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that these joint projections produce a shortened period of depolarization, sharpening the timing window over which the postsynaptic neuron can fire. Here we show that these projections can facilitate the transmission of high frequency computations even at frequencies that are highly filtered by neuronal membranes. This temporal facilitation occurred over a range of synaptic parameter values, including variations in synaptic strength, synaptic time constants, short-term synaptic depression, and the delay between excitation and inhibition. Further, these projections can coordinate computations across multiple network levels, even amid ongoing local activity. We suggest that paired feed-forward excitation and inhibition provide a hybrid signal-carrying both a value and a clock-like trigger-to allow circuits to be responsive to input whenever it arrives.





Nonlinear transient amplification in recurrent neural networks with short-term plasticity.

To rapidly process information, neural circuits have to amplify specific activity patterns transiently. How the brain performs this nonlinear operation remains elusive. Hebbian assemblies are one possibility whereby strong recurrent excitatory connections boost neuronal activity. However, such Hebbian amplification is often associated with dynamical slowing of network dynamics, non-transient attractor states, and pathological run-away activity. Feedback inhibition can alleviate these effects but typically linearizes responses and reduces amplification gain. Here, we study nonlinear transient amplification (NTA), a plausible alternative mechanism that reconciles strong recurrent excitation with rapid amplification while avoiding the above issues. NTA has two distinct temporal phases. Initially, positive feedback excitation selectively amplifies inputs that exceed a critical threshold. Subsequently, short-term plasticity quenches the run-away dynamics into an inhibition-stabilized network state. By characterizing NTA in supralinear network models, we establish that the resulting onset transients are stimulus selective and well-suited for speedy information processing. Further, we find that excitatory-inhibitory co-tuning widens the parameter regime in which NTA is possible in the absence of persistent activity. In summary, NTA provides a parsimonious explanation for how excitatory-inhibitory co-tuning and short-term plasticity collaborate in recurrent networks to achieve transient amplification.

Understanding the connectivity observed in the brain and how it emerges from local plasticity rules is a grand challenge in modern neuroscience. In the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice, synapses between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons tend to be stronger for neurons that respond to similar stimulus features, although these neurons are not topographically arranged according to their stimulus preference. The presence of such excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) neuronal assemblies indicates a stimulus-specific form of feedback inhibition. Here, we show that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity on input and output synapses of PV interneurons generates a circuit structure that is consistent with mouse V1. Computational modeling reveals that both forms of plasticity must act in synergy to form the observed E/I assemblies. Once established, these assemblies produce a stimulus-specific competition between pyramidal neurons. Our model suggests that activity-dependent plasticity can refine inhibitory circuits to actively shape cortical computations.

Changes in the short-term dynamics of excitatory synapses over development have been observed throughout cortex, but their purpose and consequences remain unclear. Here, we propose that developmental changes in synaptic dynamics buffer the effect of slow inhibitory long-term plasticity, allowing for continuously stable neural activity. Using computational modeling we demonstrate that early in development excitatory short-term depression quickly stabilises neural activity, even in the face of strong, unbalanced excitation. We introduce a model of the commonly observed developmental shift from depression to facilitation and show that neural activity remains stable throughout development, while inhibitory synaptic plasticity slowly balances excitation, consistent with experimental observations. Our model predicts changes in the input responses from phasic to phasic-and-tonic and more precise spike timings. We also observe a gradual emergence of short-lasting memory traces governed by short-term plasticity development. We conclude that the developmental depression-to-facilitation shift may control excitation-inhibition balance throughout development with important functional consequences.

Cortical circuits process information by rich recurrent interactions between excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. One of the prime functions of interneurons is to stabilize the circuit by feedback inhibition, but the level of specificity on which inhibitory feedback operates is not fully resolved. We hypothesized that inhibitory circuits could enable separate feedback control loops for different synaptic input streams, by means of specific feedback inhibition to different neuronal compartments. To investigate this hypothesis, we adopted an optimization approach. Leveraging recent advances in training spiking network models, we optimized the connectivity and short-term plasticity of interneuron circuits for compartment-specific feedback inhibition onto pyramidal neurons. Over the course of the optimization, the interneurons diversified into two classes that resembled parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that the resulting circuit can be understood as a neural decoder that inverts the nonlinear biophysical computations performed within the pyramidal cells. Our model provides a proof of concept for studying structure-function relations in cortical circuits by a combination of gradient-based optimization and biologically plausible phenomenological models.

Diverse inhibitory neurons in the mammalian brain shape circuit connectivity and dynamics through mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Inhibitory plasticity can establish excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, control neuronal firing, and affect local calcium concentration, hence regulating neuronal activity at the network, single neuron, and dendritic level. Computational models can synthesize multiple experimental results and provide insight into how inhibitory plasticity controls circuit dynamics and sculpts connectivity by identifying phenomenological learning rules amenable to mathematical analysis. We highlight recent studies on the role of inhibitory plasticity in modulating excitatory plasticity, forming structured networks underlying memory formation and recall, and implementing adaptive phenomena and novelty detection. We conclude with experimental and modeling progress on the role of interneuron-specific plasticity in circuit computation and context-dependent learning.

GABAergic inhibitory circuits play an essential role in coordinating various hippocampal functions. Several decades of work dedicated to a thorough characterization of hippocampal inhibitory populations have highlighted how specific types of interneuron can contribute to network activity. Recent studies have used genetically targeted recordings and peturbations of activity during memory-related behaviours to determine how interneurons that inhibit distinct subcellular domains of principal cells or specialize in principal cell disinhibition may sculpt hippocampal memory. These studies highlight unique contributions of distinct interneuron types to the temporal binding of hippocampal ensembles, synaptic plasticity and the acquisition of spatial and contextual information. Here, we review the current state of knowledge around hippocampal inhibition and memory by discussing the multifaceted roles of populations of inhibitory cells at different stages of hippocampal mnemonic processing.

Hippocampal place cells underlie spatial navigation and memory. Remarkably, CA1 pyramidal neurons can form new place fields within a single trial by undergoing rapid plasticity. However, local feedback circuits likely restrict the rapid recruitment of individual neurons into ensemble representations. This interaction between circuit dynamics and rapid feature coding remains unexplored. Here, we developed "all-optical" approaches combining novel optogenetic induction of rapidly forming place fields with 2-photon activity imaging during spatial navigation in mice. We find that induction efficacy depends strongly on the density of co-activated neurons. Place fields can be reliably induced in single cells, but induction fails during co-activation of larger subpopulations due to local circuit constraints imposed by recurrent inhibition. Temporary relief of local inhibition permits the simultaneous induction of place fields in larger ensembles. We demonstrate the behavioral implications of these dynamics, showing that our ensemble place field induction protocol can enhance subsequent spatial association learning.





Entorhinal cortex directs learning-related changes in CA1 representations.

Learning-related changes in brain activity are thought to underlie adaptive behaviours<sup>1,2</sup>. For instance, the learning of a reward site by rodents requires the development of an over-representation of that location in the hippocampus<sup>3-6</sup>. How this learning-related change occurs remains unknown. Here we recorded hippocampal CA1 population activity as mice learned a reward location on a linear treadmill. Physiological and pharmacological evidence suggests that the adaptive over-representation required behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP)<sup>7</sup>. BTSP is known to be driven by dendritic voltage signals that we proposed were initiated by input from entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3). Accordingly, the CA1 over-representation was largely removed by optogenetic inhibition of EC3 activity. Recordings from EC3 neurons revealed an activity pattern that could provide an instructive signal directing BTSP to generate the over-representation. Consistent with this function, our observations show that exposure to a second environment possessing a prominent reward-predictive cue resulted in both EC3 activity and CA1 place field density that were more elevated at the cue than at the reward. These data indicate that learning-related changes in the hippocampus are produced by synaptic plasticity directed by an instructive signal from the EC3 that seems to be specifically adapted to the behaviourally relevant features of the environment.

Synaptic changes are hypothesized to underlie learning and memory formation in the brain. But Hebbian synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses on its own is unstable, leading to either unlimited growth of synaptic strengths or silencing of neuronal activity without additional homeostatic mechanisms. To control excitatory synaptic strengths, we propose a novel form of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. Using computational modeling, we suggest two key features of inhibitory plasticity, dominance of inhibition over excitation and a nonlinear dependence on the firing rate of postsynaptic excitatory neurons whereby inhibitory synaptic strengths change with the same sign (potentiate or depress) as excitatory synaptic strengths. We demonstrate that the stable synaptic strengths realized by this novel inhibitory plasticity model affects excitatory/inhibitory weight ratios in agreement with experimental results. Applying a disinhibitory signal can gate plasticity and lead to the generation of receptive fields and strong bidirectional connectivity in a recurrent network. Hence, a novel form of nonlinear inhibitory plasticity can simultaneously stabilize excitatory synaptic strengths and enable learning upon disinhibition.

Synaptic plasticity plays a central role in the study of neural mechanisms of learning and memory. Plasticity rules are not invariant over time but are under neuromodulatory control, enabling behavioral states to influence memory formation. Neuromodulation controls synaptic plasticity at network level by directing information flow, at circuit level through changes in excitation/inhibition balance, and at synaptic level through modulation of intracellular signaling cascades. Although most research has focused on modulation of principal neurons, recent progress has uncovered important roles for interneurons in not only routing information, but also setting conditions for synaptic plasticity. Moreover, astrocytes have been shown to both gate and mediate plasticity. These additional mechanisms must be considered for a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of learning and memory.

One of the most captivating questions in neuroscience revolves around the brain's ability to efficiently and durably capture and store information. It must process continuous input from sensory organs while also encoding memories that can persist throughout a lifetime. What are the cellular-, subcellular-, and network-level mechanisms that underlie this remarkable capacity for long-term information storage? Furthermore, what contributions do distinct types of GABAergic interneurons make to this process? As the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in memory, our review focuses on three aspects: (1) delineation of hippocampal interneuron types and their connectivity, (2) interneuron plasticity, and (3) activity patterns of interneurons during memory-related rhythms, including the role of long-range interneurons and disinhibition. We explore how these three elements, together showcasing the remarkable diversity of inhibitory circuits, shape the processing of memories in the hippocampus.

Short-term plasticity (STP) and excitatory-inhibitory balance (EI balance) are both ubiquitous building blocks of brain circuits across the animal kingdom. The synapses involved in EI are also subject to short-term plasticity, and several experimental studies have shown that their effects overlap. Recent computational and theoretical work has begun to highlight the functional implications of the intersection of these motifs. The findings are nuanced: while there are general computational themes, such as pattern tuning, normalization, and gating, much of the richness of these interactions comes from region- and modality specific tuning of STP properties. Together these findings point towards the STP-EI balance combination as being a versatile and highly efficient neural building block for a wide range of pattern-specific responses.

We examine the efficiency of information processing in a balanced excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) network during the developmental critical period, when network plasticity is heightened. A multimodule network composed of E-I neurons was defined, and its dynamics were examined by regulating the balance between their activities. When adjusting E-I activity, both transitive chaotic synchronization with a high Lyapunov dimension and conventional chaos with a low Lyapunov dimension were found. In between, the edge of high-dimensional chaos was observed. To quantify the efficiency of information processing, we applied a short-term memory task in reservoir computing to the dynamics of our network. We found that memory capacity was maximized when optimal E-I balance was realized, underscoring both its vital role and vulnerability during critical periods of brain development.

Learning continues beyond the end of training. Post-training learning is supported by changes in plasticity and stability in the brain during both wakefulness and sleep. However, the lack of a unified measure for assessing plasticity and stability dynamics during training and post-training periods has limited our understanding of how these dynamics shape learning. Focusing primarily on procedural learning, we integrate work using behavioral paradigms and a recently developed measure, the excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) ratio, to explore the delicate balance between plasticity and stability and its relationship to post-training learning. This reveals plasticity-stability cycles during both wakefulness and sleep that enhance learning and protect it from new learning during post-training processing.

The brain's functionality is developed and maintained through synaptic plasticity. As synapses undergo plasticity, they also affect each other. The nature of such 'co-dependency' is difficult to disentangle experimentally, because multiple synapses must be monitored simultaneously. To help understand the experimentally observed phenomena, we introduce a framework that formalizes synaptic co-dependency between different connection types. The resulting model explains how inhibition can gate excitatory plasticity while neighboring excitatory-excitatory interactions determine the strength of long-term potentiation. Furthermore, we show how the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory synapses can account for the quick rise and long-term stability of a variety of synaptic weight profiles, such as orientation tuning and dendritic clustering of co-active synapses. In recurrent neuronal networks, co-dependent plasticity produces rich and stable motor cortex-like dynamics with high input sensitivity. Our results suggest an essential role for the neighborly synaptic interaction during learning, connecting micro-level physiology with network-wide phenomena.
